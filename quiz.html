        QUIZ GAME!

        RULES:
        / The player must guess correctly a certain amount of questions => count points/answers
        / Each correct answer gives him one point => increase the count on good answer
        / Answers could be multiple or true/false => 2 types of question
        / At the end of the game, the user must know his/her total score

        QUESTIONS:
        / You can get them from this URL ( http://bit.ly/strive_QUIZZ ) or you can write your own
        / Could be multiple of boolean (true / false)

        HINTS:
        / Keep a global variable score for the user score
        / Keep a variable questionNumber for the question the user is answering => questionNumber
        / When questionNumber is bigger then the available questions, present the score => questionNumber>totalQuestion => end the game
        / Start working with the questions saved in a variable (or you can use AJAX for fetching external questions if you already know how to do it!)
        / Start with the easier version and THEN implement the EXTRAs
        / Please debug everything / try it on the console to be sure of what to expect from your code

        EXTRA:
        / Show if the answer provided was the wrong one or correct it after clicking => make styling for correct/wrong answers and display after questions
        / Present the questions one at a time instead of having all of them displayed together
        / Let the user select difficulty and number of questions (you can get q/a from https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18&difficulty=easy modifying amount and difficulty)
    
        /* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
          Commit and push the code to your personal GitHub repository; then post the link of your commit on the Homework section of today's Eduflow.
        */
